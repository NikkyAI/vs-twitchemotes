# Twitch Emotes

This mod enables clientside rendering of twitch emotes

to add more channels to display emotes from, edit `VintageStoryData/ModConfig/twitchemotes.json`

the mod will download emotes as needed into `VintageStoryData/Cache/twitchemotes`

There may currently be issues with https://www.twitchemotes.com not being synchonized with twitch emote status, newer emotes may be missing, channels may be missing

this mod is most useful along with https://github.com/NikkyAI/vs-matterbridge to link twitch chat into the game
